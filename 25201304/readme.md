2.  Logistic Regression was selected as a reliable and interpretable baseline for binary heart disease prediction.
3.  It produces probability outputs, which are required for ROC-AUC evaluation. Numeric features were standardized using StandardScaler to improve numerical stability and convergence.

4. Moderate.ipynb — DS4
5. K-Nearest Neighbors was chosen because it is a distance-based algorithm that is highly sensitive to feature scaling.
6. The Breast Cancer dataset contains features with very different numeric ranges, making it ideal to demonstrate the impact of scaling.
7. Visualizations were used to justify how scaling improves neighborhood structure and classification performance.

9. Logistic Regression provides interpretable probability estimates, while Linear SVM focuses on margin maximization.
10. ROC-AUC was chosen due to class imbalance in churn data.The final decision threshold was selected based on ROC characteristics to balance false positives and false negatives in a business context.
